== BagelBox TODO

BagelBox is far from finished, it needs real world testing and more polish...

- Contemplate replacing cron with the new whenever gem

- Detect if file type meta matchars have been changed in new version and offer to merge

- Auto update, if possible from within app

- Freeze gems/rails inside to make it standalone (if possible), preferable with GitStack(?)

- Make sure current UI is cross-browser

- iPhone specific interface for adding/enabling filters and watching downloads

- Instead of downloading the data_file directly store it in the database, so we can do queued downloading (optional per source: ftp!)

- Verify download before deactivating filters (combine with queue?)

- Handle failed downloads gracefully, make sure they are not matched again?

- Create data_file_filters from every downloaded file automatically to prevent duplicate downloads with generic filters

- 'Search' content sources: some sites offer a rss stream for a search term. It would be nice to 
  use that as a content source dynamically based on active positive filters.
  
- List of all downloaded objects (also available via RSS)
