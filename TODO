- More specs

- Add Auto refresh option to log page

- View amount of MB downloaded (or other kind of progress)

- Detect if file type meta matchars have been changed in new version and offer to merge

- Auto update, if possible from within app

- Freeze gems/rails inside to make it standalone (if possible)

- Make sure current UI is cross-browser

- 'Search' content sources: some sites offer a rss stream for a search term. It would be nice to 
  use that as a content source dynamically based on active positive filters.
  
- List of all downloaded objects (also available via RSS)
