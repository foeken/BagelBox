== BagelBox TODO

BagelBox is far from finished, it needs real world testing and more polish...

- Instead of downloading the data_file directly store it in the database, so we can do queued downloading (optional per source: ftp!)

- Verify download before deactivating filters (combine with queue?)

- Handle failed downloads gracefully, make sure they are not matched again?

- Create data_file_filters from every downloaded file automatically to prevent duplicate downloads with generic filters

- 'Search' content sources: some sites offer a rss stream for a search term. It would be nice to 
  use that as a content source dynamically based on active positive filters.
  
- List of all downloaded objects (also available via RSS)
